# Collection of data called database.

# MongoDB is a NoSQL(non-relational)database. it stores data in the type of JSON format called BSON.

# BINARYJSON(BSON) . BSON has more data types than JSON. [string, double,32-bit-integer,64-bit-integer, Boolean, array, object, null, regular expression, timestamp, 
date, objectid ]. The number is only the datatype that is present in JSON but not in BSON. Data is saved in Binary format. Faster than JSON.    


# SQL database stores data in tables.

# NoSQL database stores data in the form of a document. Data stored in collection.
